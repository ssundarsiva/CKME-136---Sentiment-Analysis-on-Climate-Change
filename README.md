# CKME-136---Sentiment-Analysis-on-Climate-Change
The main research question of this project is:  ‘Are people's general opinion about climate change positive or negative? Do people believe in climate change more or do they deny it?’   This project seeks to explore a global cross-section of Twitter data about climate change using text classification and sentiment analysis.
